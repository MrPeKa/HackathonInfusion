# HackathonInfusion

Project made at the Hackathon organised by Infusion in Poland.
20th August 2016

2nd place in team with @blisek.

Main goal was to find the exit from maze, but in every next round, the maze was more complicated.
We created bot, which knew only the start position and the position of exit. You had to discover the whole maze to find the right way.
Communication with the serwer was by Web API and json was the type of data.
